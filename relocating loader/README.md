 # AIM:
 
 
 ### To write a "C" program for the implementation of Relocating Loader in - System Software Lab.
 
 ### Algorithm:-
STEP 1: Start the program execution.<br>
STEP 2: Enter the starting address location for relocating the object code.<br>
STEP 3: Transfer the input array into output array.<br>
STEP 4: Convert the current string array into binary form,where current string is
relocating bit.<br>
STEP 5: Relocating bit is subjected to required changes before transferring input to
output and also move object code<br>
STEP 6: Stop the program execution.<br>
